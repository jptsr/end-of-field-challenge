# end-of-field-challenge

**Group work**

*HTML, SCSS/CSS, JS*

Reproduction of a responsive landing page. We were two to realise this challenge. The work was part in a way where both of us could code in HTML and SCSS/CSS. The work was equally distributed. Axel made the hamburger menu in Javascript.
